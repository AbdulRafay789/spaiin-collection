We all have a child inside, so let&#8217;s see what was recorded in her memory, the sensations and experiences that will stay with her forever.<\/p>\n<p>They say that the sense of smell is the human being\u2019s strongest sense and that smells spark memories of emotions and experiences.

After giving it some thought she said, &#8220;Mommy, the \u201cPORRA\u201d and the \u201cMOLLETES\u201d, the trip to El Torcal and being able to enter the Dolmens, but the best part was the food&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>I was not disappointed.

I can feel the humidity of the stone and I relive the emotion my daughter and I felt when we entered the interior of the dolmens, which are part of one of the most important megalithic complexes in Europe. It is an amazing place, where you can feel the power of nature.<\/p>\n<p>For the inhabitants of this area some 6,500 years ago this was a magical place and it still is. The dolmens of <em>Menga<\/em>, <em>Viera<\/em>, and the <em>Tholos of El Romeral<\/em> (circular funeral construction), face two natural landmarks: the Pe\u00f1a de los Enamorados (a hill in the shape of a human face) and El Torcal de Antequera. This is one of the first known examples of the integration of architecture and natural landscape in European prehistory.<\/p>\n<p>This area demonstrates the ancestral union of man with nature. For this reason, on 15 July 2016, UNESCO declared the megalithic complex and the two natural monuments as World Heritage Sites. The visual impact for anyone open and receptive to this type of thing is huge. For two girls like us, one 12 and the other 49 years old, our jaws literally dropped in awe.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s why the next day Lili\u00e1n and I, with walking shoes on and backpacks ready, spent the day in El Torcal, in an attempt to understand the relationship between the monuments.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>The most important karst landscape in Europe.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>El Torcal de Antequera is breath-taking, it makes you feel small and insignificant.\u00a0 It&#8217;s like entering an unreal fairy world. The information center explains how it was formed, which to summarise, was due to wind and water erosion on the limestone rocks during the Jurassic period, between 250 and 150 million years ago. It is a unique place, as are the flora and fauna, so it is a must for lovers of nature in its purest form, and for lovers of silence, the wind and endless walks. It is like a petrified city, frozen in time. It looks like one of Gaudi&#8217;s masterpieces, a combination of the &#8220;Sagrada Familia&#8221; and &#8220;La Pedrera&#8221;, but yet it was Mother Nature who carved a spectacular collection of passageways and rock formations that make us feel like we\u2019re on a different planet. Who knows if Gaud\u00ed walked here once?<\/p>\n<p>On the last day of our little adventure, we decided to lose ourselves in the small streets of Antequera, and visit some of its museums, churches and convents &#8211; home to examples of baroque and renaissance art that are unparalleled. A visit of the town\u2019s Alcazaba takes us back to the time of Muslim rule.<\/p>\n<p>Antequera is like a box of chocolates, it may be small, but it has something for everyone. It is impossible to do it justice, you just have to come and see for yourself.

It is located approximately 110 kms (70 miles) from Santiago de Compostela and from here you will get the right amount of typical Galician mountain-like landscape on your way to Santiago. In terms of difficulty, it is an easy to moderate portion of El Camino and the stages can be broken down to average daily walks of about 20-25 kms (12-13 miles). The scenery along the way is fabulous and very rural for the most part.

There you can find the original deep well, to which one of the most famous miracles of Saint Isidore is related. Legend has it that one day, while Isidore worked in the fields, his son fell into the well.

Tradition dictates that one should go on a pilgrimage to this spring, which has healing properties, and visit the <em>Hermitage of Saint Isidore<\/em>, located in the meadowlands bearing same name. This chapel was originally constructed under the order of the empress Isabella of Portugal in 1528, after his son, the future king Philip II, healed thanks to the spring. Since then, people go there on 15 May to drink the water of this healing spring and to worship the saint.<\/p>\n<p>Another important tradition is the visit to the <em>Chapel of Saint Isidore<\/em>, which was erected in the ox stables, as a different miracle of the saint happened there. Legend has it that one morning the landlord went secretly to observe if Isidore was working the land, as the other workers had complained that he spent at prayer in church. The landlord saw two angels helping Isidore with the plowing, each angel leading a yoke of white oxen.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"Madrid is a city that can be discovered in many different ways: visiting the numerous museums, walking through the old center of Madrid of the Austrians, enjoying the Spanish tapas in taverns and inns\u2026 This time you will discover Madrid following the life and miracles of its patron saint, San Isidro Labrador.","images":[{"image":false,"size":"vertical"},{"image":"https:\/\/spaincollection.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Nr.6.San_.Isidro.jpg","size":"vertical"},{"image":false,"size":"horizontal"}]},{"acf_fc_layout":"quote","title":"Tradition dictates that one should go on a pilgrimage to this spring, which has healing properties, and visit the Hermitage of Saint Isidore, located in the meadowlands bearing same name."},{"acf_fc_layout":"wysiwyg","wysiwyg":"<p>However, the most important monument dedicated to this saint is, undoubtedly, the <em>Collegiate Church<\/em> of <em>Saint Isidore,<\/em> that contains the relics of Madrid\u2019s patron saint and his wife, Santa Mar\u00eda de la Cabeza.

Both father and son love Spain and have Spanish ancestors (Martin\u2019s father was an immigrant from Galicia and he still keeps his real name Ram\u00f3n Estevez on his passport)<\/p>\n<p>This is a father-son story of redemption, forgiveness and adventure.\u00a0\u201cThe Way\u201d helps the audience grasp the basics of what\u00a0<em>el Camino de Santiago<\/em>\u00a0pilgrimage is about. It is a lot of fun to watch too. I am also tied to the film, as I assisted Emilio and the crew when they filmed across the region of La Rioja. I was able to meet and spend some time with Martin, Emilio and the rest of the production team and they even had my friend Leo and I play extras in the film, only to realize later on, we were just two blurry dots in the background of a scene where Martin Sheen gets all the attention and takes all credit.

Looking for a greater purpose within his ministry, he put together a pilgrimage in the whole sense of the word. He gathered a bunch of young adults from his parish and offered them the chance to participate on a journey that millions of pilgrims had taken before them. His only promise to them was that of long hours of walking, very changeable weather conditions, a few blisters here and there, and a chance to find themselves and God along the way. Suffice to say, the stunning scenery of northern Spain, deepening their catholic roots and receiving plenary indulgence were also a bonus to consider.<\/p>\n<p>The idea of producing and filming this was Juan Manuel Cotelo\u2019s, and he directs this very personal and spiritual approach to El Camino. Then along came Netflix and this documentary became famous across the world.<\/p>\n<p>The group walked along the less traveled path, the Northern Coastal route, which is pretty hard at times but hugely rewarding in terms of natural beauty. Cotelo does not present us with a road movie here, but rather an inner journey where you see the protagonists both endure and have the time of their lives. Through his exceptional spiritual guidance, Father Sergio created a sense of camaraderie and an unbreakable bond amongst the group. I was lucky to meet Father Sergio on one of my trips to Arizona and somehow become a part of this compassionate and moving story, one that has become the catalyst for many to embark on the adventure of walking El Camino de Santiago.<\/p>\n<p><strong><u>El Camino, Looking for Infinity (Documentary.

Longing to be one them.<\/p>\n<p>El Camino has a very spiritual attraction to it, and the fact that you have to walk brings you somehow to a more human-like pace and dimension.

As we sample some cod or some other traditional culinary Portuguese treat, he\u2019ll explain the fascinating history behind this UNESCO-listed cultural heritage which is still very much alive, and part of Portugal\u2019s make up even in the 21st Century.
